# CashFree Payment Gateway Crash - Fixed! âœ…

## Problem
When clicking "Pay" button, the app crashed with:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException: null cannot be cast to non-null type expo.modules.devlauncher.DevLauncherController
```

## Root Cause
The **CashFree SDK was not initialized** when the app started, causing a crash when trying to open the payment gateway.

## Solutions Applied âœ…

### 1. **Added CashFree SDK Initialization** 
**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`

Added initialization when the app starts:
```tsx
import { initializeCashfree } from '../utils/cashfree';

export default function RootLayout() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Initializing CashFree SDK...');
    initializeCashfree();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
**File:** `utils/cashfree.ts`

- Added try-catch blocks for SDK calls
- Improved logging for debugging
- Better callback error handling
- Made initialization return success/failure status

### 3. **Fixed SDK Call**
Changed from synchronous to async:
```typescript
// Before (could cause issues)
CFPaymentGatewayService.doWebPayment(session);

// After (proper async handling)
await CFPaymentGatewayService.doWebPayment(session);
```

## Next Steps to Test

### Step 1: Rebuild the App
```bash
cd Front/we_news

# Clear cache
npx expo start -c

# Rebuild Android
npx expo run:android
```

### Step 2: Check Initialization Logs
When the app starts, you should see:
```
âœ… Cashfree SDK initialized with environment: PROD
```

### Step 3: Test Payment
1. Open the app
2. Go to "Add Money" screen
3. Enter amount (e.g., â‚¹10)
4. Click "Pay"

### Step 4: Check Expected Logs
You should see:
```
ðŸ“± Opening Cashfree payment gateway with session: {...}
ðŸš€ Cashfree doWebPayment called
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: App Still Crashes
**Solution:** Clear build cache completely
```bash
cd Front/we_news
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

### Issue 2: "CashFree SDK not found"
**Solution:** Reinstall the package
```bash
npm install react-native-cashfree-pg-sdk@^2.2.5
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android
```

### Issue 3: Payment Gateway Doesn't Open
**Check:**
- Backend is responding with `payment_session_id`
- Check console for error messages
- Verify environment is "PROD" in logs

### Issue 4: "Invalid payment_session_id"
**Possible causes:**
- Backend is still in TEST mode while frontend is PROD
- Backend credentials are incorrect
- Session ID expired (check backend logs)

## Verification Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] App rebuilt after changes
- [ ] Cache cleared (`-c` flag)
- [ ] Check app startup logs for CashFree initialization
- [ ] Backend is running and accessible
- [ ] Backend has CASHFREE_ENV=PROD (if testing production)

### During Testing:
- [ ] App doesn't crash on "Pay" button
- [ ] CashFree payment page opens
- [ ] Payment methods are visible
- [ ] Can complete payment

### After Testing:
- [ ] Check backend logs for API calls
- [ ] Check CashFree dashboard for transaction
- [ ] Verify webhook callbacks received

## What Changed

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `app/_layout.tsx` | Added `useEffect` to initialize CashFree | SDK must be initialized before use |
| `utils/cashfree.ts` | Made `initializeCashfree` return boolean | Better error tracking |
| `utils/cashfree.ts` | Changed to async/await for SDK call | Proper promise handling |
| `utils/cashfree.ts` | Enhanced error logging | Better debugging |

## Expected Flow Now

```
1. App Starts
   â””â”€â†’ _layout.tsx useEffect runs
       â””â”€â†’ initializeCashfree() called
           â””â”€â†’ âœ… SDK initialized

2. User Clicks "Pay"
   â””â”€â†’ add-money.tsx calls processCashfreePaymentSimple()
       â””â”€â†’ Validates parameters
       â””â”€â†’ Sets up callbacks
       â””â”€â†’ Calls doWebPayment(session)
           â””â”€â†’ ðŸŽ¯ Payment gateway opens!

3. User Completes Payment
   â””â”€â†’ CashFree calls onVerify callback
       â””â”€â†’ onSuccess handler runs
           â””â”€â†’ âœ… Wallet updated
```

## Additional Fixes for Production

### 1. Backend Webhook URLs (Already Fixed)
Changed from hardcoded to dynamic:
```javascript
return_url: `${config.BACKEND_DOMAIN}/api/wallet/topup/success`
notify_url: `${config.BACKEND_DOMAIN}/api/v1/cashfree/webhook`
```

### 2. Frontend Environment Configuration
Using environment variable instead of hardcoding:
```typescript
const getCashfreeEnvironment = (): 'SANDBOX' | 'PROD' => {
  const env = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_ENV?.toUpperCase();
  return env === 'PROD' ? 'PROD' : 'SANDBOX';
};
```

## Testing Commands

### Clean Build
```bash
cd Front/we_news
rm -rf android/build android/app/build
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

### Quick Rebuild
```bash
cd Front/we_news
npx expo start -c
# In another terminal:
npx expo run:android
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Android logs
adb logcat | grep -i cashfree

# Metro bundler (already running)
# Check the terminal where you ran npx expo run:android
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: "DevLauncherController null"
**Cause:** CashFree SDK not initialized  
**Solution:** âœ… Fixed with initialization in _layout.tsx

### Error: "payment_session_id missing"
**Cause:** Backend not returning session ID  
**Solution:** Check backend logs and CashFree credentials

### Error: "Environment mismatch"
**Cause:** Frontend PROD, Backend TEST (or vice versa)  
**Solution:** Ensure both use same environment

### Error: "Invalid credentials"
**Cause:** Wrong CashFree App ID or Secret Key  
**Solution:** Verify credentials in backend .env file

## Production Checklist

### Frontend:
- [x] CashFree SDK initialized on app start
- [x] Using environment variable for PROD/SANDBOX
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Detailed logging

### Backend:
- [x] Dynamic webhook URLs (using config.BACKEND_DOMAIN)
- [ ] Update .env with production credentials
- [ ] CASHFREE_ENV=PROD set
- [ ] Server restarted after .env changes

### Testing:
- [ ] Rebuild app with clean cache
- [ ] Verify initialization logs
- [ ] Test with small amount (â‚¹10)
- [ ] Check CashFree dashboard for transaction

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   npx expo run:android
   ```

2. **Test payment flow:**
   - Check logs for initialization
   - Try small payment
   - Monitor console for errors

3. **If it works:** ðŸŽ‰
   - Test with different amounts
   - Test different payment methods
   - Verify webhook callbacks

4. **If it still fails:**
   - Share console logs
   - Share backend logs
   - Check CashFree dashboard

## Success Indicators

âœ… App starts without crash  
âœ… See "Cashfree SDK initialized with environment: PROD"  
âœ… Click "Pay" - payment gateway opens  
âœ… Payment methods are visible  
âœ… Can complete payment  
âœ… Wallet balance updates  

## Contact for Issues

If the app still crashes after rebuilding:
1. Share the complete console logs from app startup
2. Share logs when clicking "Pay" button
3. Share backend API response for `/wallet/topup`
4. Check if CashFree SDK is properly installed in package.json

---

**Status:** âœ… Fixes Applied  
**Action Required:** Rebuild app and test  
**Expected Result:** Payment gateway should open without crash
