# CashFree Not Working - Development Build Issue

## The Real Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è

The error `DevLauncherController null` happens because:

**CashFree SDK (`react-native-cashfree-pg-sdk`) is NOT compatible with Expo Dev Client!**

The SDK requires native modules that conflict with Expo's development launcher.

## Solution 1: Build Release/Preview APK (RECOMMENDED) ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Build Release APK Locally

```powershell
cd Front\we_news

# Build release variant
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

Or build manually:
```powershell
cd Front\we_news\android
.\gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be at:
# android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

### Step 2: Install APK on Device

```powershell
# Install the release APK
adb install android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

### Step 3: Test Payment

Now CashFree will work! The release build doesn't have the Dev Launcher.

## Solution 2: Use EAS Build (Cloud Build) üöÄ

### Step 1: Configure EAS

```powershell
cd Front\we_news

# Login to Expo
npx eas login

# Configure EAS
npx eas build:configure
```

### Step 2: Create Build Profile

Update `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "distribution": "internal"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Build APK

```powershell
# Build preview APK
npx eas build --profile preview --platform android
```

This will build in the cloud and give you a downloadable APK.

## Solution 3: Disable Dev Client Temporarily ‚ö°

### Modify `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "WeNews",
    "slug": "we-news",
    // ... other config
    "plugins": [
      // Remove or comment expo-dev-client if present
    ]
  }
}
```

### Rebuild:

```powershell
cd Front\we_news
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

## Why This Happens

| Component | Development Build | Release Build |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Expo Dev Client | ‚úÖ Included | ‚ùå Not included |
| CashFree SDK | ‚ùå Conflicts | ‚úÖ Works perfectly |
| Hot Reload | ‚úÖ Available | ‚ùå Not available |
| Fast Refresh | ‚úÖ Available | ‚ùå Not available |

**The conflict:** Expo Dev Client's launcher intercepts native module calls, causing CashFree SDK to fail.

## Quick Test Commands

### Option A: Release Build (Fastest)

```powershell
cd Front\we_news

# Clean and build release
npx expo prebuild --clean
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease

# Install
adb install app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

# Open app and test payment
```

### Option B: EAS Build (Best for Production)

```powershell
cd Front\we_news

# Build in cloud
npx eas build --profile preview --platform android --local

# This builds locally without uploading code
# You get an APK file when done
```

## Verification Steps

### After Installing Release APK:

1. **Open the app** (not through Expo Go or Dev Client)
2. **Go to Add Money**
3. **Enter amount and click Pay**
4. **Check logcat for errors:**

```powershell
adb logcat | Select-String "CashFree|cashfree|wenews"
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Setting up CashFree callbacks...
‚úÖ Callbacks set successfully
üì± Attempting to open Cashfree payment gateway...
üöÄ Cashfree payment gateway opened successfully
```

## Expected Behavior

### Development Build (npx expo run:android):
- ‚ùå CashFree crashes with DevLauncher error
- ‚úÖ Other features work with hot reload

### Release Build (--variant release):
- ‚úÖ CashFree works perfectly
- ‚ùå No hot reload (need to rebuild for changes)

## Recommended Workflow

### During Development (Non-payment features):
```powershell
npx expo start
# Use development build
```

### Testing Payments:
```powershell
# Build release
cd Front\we_news\android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
adb install app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
# Test payment in release app
```

### For Production:
```powershell
# Use EAS Build
npx eas build --profile production --platform android
```

## Alternative: Use Different Payment SDK

If you need development build compatibility, consider:

1. **Razorpay SDK** - Better Expo compatibility
2. **Paytm SDK** - Works with Expo dev client
3. **Custom WebView** - CashFree checkout URL in WebView

### Custom WebView Approach:

```typescript
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

// Instead of SDK, use WebView
<WebView
  source={{ uri: `${cashfreeBaseURL}/checkout?payment_session_id=${sessionId}` }}
  onNavigationStateChange={handleNavigation}
/>
```

This works in dev builds but has less smooth UX.

## Current Recommendation üéØ

**Use Release Build for Testing Payments:**

```powershell
# One-time setup
cd Front\we_news
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Every time you need to test payments:
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
adb install app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

# Test payment
adb logcat | Select-String "CashFree"
```

This is the **fastest and most reliable** way to test CashFree payments during development.

## Summary

| Method | Works? | Hot Reload? | Build Time | Best For |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Dev Build (`npx expo run:android`) | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | Fast | Other features |
| Release Build (`--variant release`) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | Medium | Payment testing |
| EAS Build | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | Slow | Production |
| WebView Approach | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Fast | Dev + Testing |

## Next Steps

1. **Build release APK:**
   ```powershell
   cd Front\we_news\android
   .\gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

2. **Install on device:**
   ```powershell
   adb install app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
   ```

3. **Test payment** - Should work without crashes! ‚úÖ

**The error you're seeing is NOT a bug in your code - it's a known incompatibility between Expo Dev Client and native payment SDKs like CashFree.**

Use release builds for payment testing! üöÄ
